# Team stability in open-source projects

In open-source projects, anybody can inspect, modify, and share the source of the software.

Developers contribute to open-source projects differently; some contribute regularly whereas others occasionally. I made this vizualization to represent these dynamics.

In the vizualization below, each developer is depicted by a dot, and each iteration is represented by a different color. The nickname of the developer is displayed in a big label when the mouse pointer is over the corresponding dot. The number of iterations in which the developer contributed is shown between brackets.

It's easy to see how some developers contribute to the project regularly and how others do it sporadically. We already know about the multiple benefits of open-source, even when the contributions are not so frequent. Still, one might be wondering how these contributions affect the project in terms of productivity. Do you want to know the answer? I invite you to read one of my papers:
