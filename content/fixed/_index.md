I am a Data Analytics Engineer, Researcher, and Lecturer with over ten years of experience collecting, organising, and analysing data from different sources. I specialise in Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and agile software development.

My interests are mainly related to the application of AI/ML to solve relevant problems. I am also interested in software engineering, agile software development, and software process improvement.
